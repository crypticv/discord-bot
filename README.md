# CodeTode Discord Bot
The codeTode(); Discord Server bot.

This bot is custom made for the [CodeTode Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tVzW6JE/).

### Token.

To use this bot yourself, make a new json file named auth.json and import the folowing lines:
```
{
  "token" : "token from Discord developer panel (link at the bottom of this readme) "
}
```
### Setting the prefix.

The next thing you want to do is to say this command in the Discord where this is going to be:
> Please note that this is per token, you cant have the same bot with the same token in 2 servers and have the prefix be different in one of the 2 servers.
```
$prefix [the prefix you want]
```
Example: 
```
$prefix !
```
Response from bot will be:
```
`The prefix is now !`
```
Or if you don't have administrator permissions:
```
'You don't have permission for this command.
 Please ask staff if it's important.`
```
### And thats it!

have fun with your bot!
