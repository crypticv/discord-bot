# CodeTode Discord Bot
The codeTode(); Discord Server bot.

This bot is custom made for the [CodeTode Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tVzW6JE/).

To use this bot yourself, make a new json file named auth.json and import the folowing lines:

<header>{
  "token":"[token from Discord developer panel]"
}</header>

The next thing you want to do is to say this command: (if you have got administrator)

<header> $prefix [the prefix you want] </header>

And thats it, have fun with your bot!
